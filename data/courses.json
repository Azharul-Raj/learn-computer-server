        "description":"JavaScript is a programming language used primarily by Web browsers to create a dynamic and interactive experience for the user. Most of the functions and applications that make the Internet indispensable to modern life are coded in some form of JavaScript.The earliest incarnations of JavaScript were developed in the late 1990s for the Netscape Navigator Web browser. At the time, Web pages were static, offering little user interaction beyond clicking links and loading new pages. For the first time, JavaScript enabled animation, adaptive content and form validation on the page.For many years, JavaScript only functioned on a limited number of browsers. Microsoft's Internet Explorer, the largest browser base, did not support JavaScript until much later. Instead, Microsoft created its own proprietary client-side script called JScript. In the early days of Web development, programmers who wished to create dynamic websites were often forced to choose one browser family over the other. This was less than ideal because it made the Internet less universally accessible.JavaScript did not become standardized and widely adopted until 1999. Even after standardization, browser compatibility remained an issue for over a decade.",

        "description":"For more than a decade, we’ve seen articles that ask, “Is PHP Dead?,” with competitors such as JavaScript hoping to take its place. Over the years, PHP has held its dominant spot as the backbone to 80% of websites, give or take a few percentage points — a sign that PHP is here to stay. And there’s a very good reason why.While PHP is an older programming language lacking some of the features of newer programming languages, it has continued to evolve. With that evolution comes a level of maturity: PHP is well-documented, well-supported, and easy to use.PHP developers have access to rich frameworks, databases, and libraries to support their work, with the flexibility to set up on any Linux, Windows, or Unix OS. Most web hosting providers offer PHP, and, when it comes to cost, PHP often comes out ahead in both development time as well as overall cost to run and maintain. As an efficient language, PHP is able to deliver on the high performance times demanded by today’s consumersDuring your product development planning, PHP often comes out ahead because it is well documented in APIs. Your PHP-based website can easily be integrated with all CMS programs and add-ons to create dynamic, interactive, feature rich experiences.",

        "description":"C++ is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language that was designed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979 to be an extension of the C language. It has the features of imperative, object-oriented as well as generic programming models. C++ also has some additional facilities to those in C such as classes, inheritance, default function argument, etc. C++ plays quite an integral role in modern times as many contemporary systems such as operating systems, web browsers, databases, etc. have C++ code in at least some part of their codebase. Moreover, C++ is quite useful in performance-critical areas because of its speed.C++ is one of the most popular languages in the world. It is used by some 4.4 million developers worldwide. Also, C++ Developers are quite sought and they hold some of the most high-paying jobs in the industry with an average base pay of $103, 035 per year. C++ has the Standard Template Library(STL) which is very useful as it helps in writing code compactly and quickly as required. It contains mainly four components i.e. algorithms, containers, functions, and iterators. The algorithms are of different types such as sorting, searching, etc. The containers store classes to implement different data structures that are commonly used such as stacks, queues, hash tables, vectors, sets, lists, maps, etc. The functors allow the working of the associated function to be customized with the help of the parameters passed. Also, the iterators are used for working upon a sequence of values. ",

It's used in everything from machine learning to building websites and software testing. It can be used by developers and non-developers alike.Python, one of the most popular programming languages in the world, has created everything from Netflix’s recommendation algorithm to the software that controls self-driving cars. Python is a general-purpose language, which means it’s designed to be used in a range of applications, including data science, software and web development, automation, and generally getting stuff done.On The other hand Java is one of the most popular programming languages used to create Web applications and platforms. It was designed for flexibility, allowing developers to write code that would run on any machine, regardless of architecture or platform. According to the Java home page, more than 1 billion computers and 3 billion mobile phones worldwide run Java.Java is used to build applications and platforms for a number of devices, including computers, laptops, gaming consoles, Blu-ray players, car navigation systems, medical monitoring devices, parking meters, lottery terminals and smartphones. It is also a key language for networking, particularly for data centers that store and transfer Web-based data.",

Photoshop offers users the ability to create, enhance, or otherwise edit images, artwork, and illustrations. Changing backgrounds, simulating a real-life painting, or creating an alternative view of the universe are all possible with Adobe Photoshop. It is the most widely used software tool for photo editing, image manipulation, and retouching for numerous image and video file formats. The tools within Photoshop make it possible to edit both individual images as well as large batches of photos. There are several versions of Photoshop, including Photoshop CC, Photoshop Elements, Photoshop Lightroom and Photoshop Express, a version of Photoshop for iOS with reduced features. Adobe Photoshop is available on its own as a subscription that includes Photoshop Lightroom, and as part of the larger Creative Cloud subscription.Adobe Photoshop CC is the Creative Cloud version of Photoshop, available by subscription. It is considered to be the professional-level version of the Photoshop family of products. Photoshop CC is available together with Photoshop Lightroom, or as part of a larger Creative Cloud subscription. Photoshop CC is an advanced imaging software used by designers, web professionals, video editors, and photographers to alter or manipulate digital images.

It is mainly used to modify vector graphics and is used by both artists and graphic designers to create vector images. It is by far the easiest method for creating and editing scalable content that can be repeated through a wide variety of channels at any size. We will create designs for very small file sizes that are capable of being printed in high quality.It is also often used to create business posters, illustrations, diagrams, charts, cartoons with real photographs, product advertisements, and other forms of advertising, as well as personal work, both in print and digital media. Illustrator allows it easy to build and change any entity since no prior drawing or painting knowledge is neededAs with freehand drawings, we can construct everything. Importing photographs is a genius move in this app, since it acts as a guide for tracing and recolouring a single subject, transforming it into an artwork with a strong resemblance to freehand drawings. There are many Adobe Illustrator Training Institutes in Delhi that offer professional level training and ensuring that all pertinent topics are covered, from basic to advanced.",

Most importantly, Swift is designed to make writing and maintaining correct programs easier for the developer. To achieve this goal, we believe that the most obvious way to write Swift code must also beThe most obvious way to write code should also behave in a safe manner. Undefined behavior is the enemy of safety, and developer mistakes should be caught before software is in production. Opting for safety sometimes means Swift will feel strict, but we believe that clarity saves time in the long run. Swift is intended as a replacement for C-based languages (C, C++, and Objective-C). As such, Swift must be comparable to those languages in performance for most tasks. Performance must also be predictable and consistent, not just fast in short bursts that require clean-up later. There are lots of languages with novel features — being fast is rare.Swift benefits from decades of advancement in computer science to offer syntax that is a joy to use, with modern features developers expect. But Swift is never done. We will monitor language advancements and embrace what works, continually evolving to make Swift even better.",

As a superset of the C programming language, it offers the ability for developers to be more detail-oriented as well as more supportive of objects and other languagesThere are varied programming languages. At present, three programming languages are in great demand, i.e., Swift, Objective C, and C++. Let’s see some of the basic differences between Objective-C and the other 2 languages:Swift is the programming language that was first launched by Apple in June 2014. Objective-C yields all warts you’d expect from a language formed on C. To distinguish keywords and types from C types, Objective-C preceded new keywords applying the @ symbol. Because Swift isn’t made on C, it can ally all the keywords and extract the numerous @ symbols in the presence of every Objective-C type or object-related keyword",
